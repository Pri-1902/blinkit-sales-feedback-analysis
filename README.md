# Blinkit-sales-feedback-analysis
This project analyses Blinkit's sales data and customer feedback from 2023 and 2024 to uncover key business insights.


**Introduction:**
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance and customer feedback for the years 2023 and 2024. The primary objective is to uncover meaningful business insights that can drive informed decision-making, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize sales strategies.
Using MySQL, detailed queries were written to explore sales patterns across time, identify high- and low-performing product categories, and investigate seasonal or regional trends. To complement the quantitative analysis, customer feedback data was analyzed to understand common pain points—especially around service issues like late deliveries and negative sentiment.
The insights generated from the SQL analysis were then visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard, enabling stakeholders to easily explore trends, track key metrics, and identify actionable opportunities for growth and service improvement.
